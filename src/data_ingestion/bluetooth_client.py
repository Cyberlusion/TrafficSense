# Bluetooth data can be collected using protocols like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), with specific libraries for BLE communication.
# For example, in Python, you could use the bluepy or pybluez library to interact with Bluetooth devices.
# For simplicity, let's assume a Bluetooth probe detects devices by their MAC address, signal strength (RSSI), and timestamp.
