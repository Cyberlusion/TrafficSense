# Set Up Traffic Camera Feed Access
# Traffic cameras typically provide an RTSP URL for live streaming. Hereâ€™s an example of how to read a camera feed using OpenCV:

import cv2
import logging

def start_camera_stream(camera_url):
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(camera_url)
    if not cap.isOpened():
        logging.error(f"Failed to open camera stream: {camera_url}")
        return

    while cap.isOpened():
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            logging.error("Failed to receive frame from camera.")
            break

        # Process the frame (e.g., vehicle detection)
        process_frame(frame)

    cap.release()

def process_frame(frame):
    # Placeholder for actual processing (e.g., vehicle detection)
    cv2.imshow('Traffic Camera Feed', frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        return
# This start_camera_stream function initializes a connection to the camera, continuously reads frames, and calls process_frame on each frame.
