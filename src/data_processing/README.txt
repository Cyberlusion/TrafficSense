To build the data_processing layer, weâ€™ll focus on implementing the core logic for handling, transforming, and analyzing the ingested data. This layer will take data from the ingestion stage (likely through a message broker like Kafka) and perform calculations or transformations required for traffic analysis, such as real-time aggregation, anomaly detection, or congestion estimation.
