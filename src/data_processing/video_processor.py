# Step 2: Implement Video Processing for Key Metrics
# You can use pre-trained models like YOLO or MobileNet to detect vehicles, count them, and classify traffic conditions in real-time.
# Hereâ€™s a simplified version of processing using OpenCV and a mock detection function.

import cv2

def process_frame(frame):
    # Example: Use a pre-trained model for object detection
    # Here, we simulate vehicle detection for simplicity
    vehicle_count = detect_vehicles(frame)
    analyze_traffic(vehicle_count)

def detect_vehicles(frame):
    # Simulated detection logic
    # Use a real object detection model like YOLO in production
    return 5  # Placeholder for the number of detected vehicles

def calculate_congestion_level(vehicle_count):
    # Example congestion calculation based on vehicle count
    # Simple rule: congestion level out of 100
    if vehicle_count < 10:
        return 20  # Low congestion
    elif vehicle_count < 20:
        return 50  # Moderate congestion
    else:
        return 90  # High congestion
