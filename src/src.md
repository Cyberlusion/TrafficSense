The `/src` folder will serve as the main directory for all source code, organized into logical modules and components for your project. Since this project involves live traffic calculation using IoT and telemetry data, you’ll want to structure it to separate data ingestion, processing, storage, API handling, and utilities. Here’s a suggested organization:

```
/src
├── data_ingestion        # Handles receiving data from IoT sources and queuing for processing
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── mqtt_client.py    # Handles MQTT client setup and messaging
│   ├── http_client.py    # Pulls data from HTTP sources if needed
│   ├── kafka_producer.py # Sends received data to Kafka or another messaging queue
│   └── config.py         # Configuration for data sources (MQTT, HTTP)
│
├── data_processing       # Responsible for data analysis, cleaning, and real-time calculations
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── processor.py      # Core processing logic, e.g., data transformations, aggregations
│   ├── analyzer.py       # Implements algorithms for traffic calculation, anomaly detection, etc.
│   ├── stream_processor.py # For real-time data stream handling (e.g., using Spark, Flink)
│   └── config.py         # Configuration for processing thresholds, parameters, etc.
│
├── data_storage          # Manages storing raw and processed data in databases
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── db_handler.py     # Handles database connections, CRUD operations
│   ├── schema.py         # Defines data schemas for tables, collections, etc.
│   └── config.py         # Database connection configurations
│
├── api                   # Exposes processed data through RESTful API endpoints
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app.py            # Main API app setup (using Flask/FastAPI)
│   ├── routes.py         # Defines individual endpoints for data retrieval, control, etc.
│   └── config.py         # API settings, including host, port, authentication settings
│
├── utils                 # Helper functions and utilities
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── logger.py         # Centralized logging setup
│   ├── validator.py      # Input validation functions
│   ├── config_loader.py  # Helper to load configurations from files/environment
│   └── helper.py         # Other reusable utilities (e.g., formatting, conversions)
│
└── main.py               # Entry point to initialize the ingestion and processing pipeline
```

### Explanation of Each Folder

1. **`data_ingestion`**: Contains modules for receiving data from IoT devices via different protocols (MQTT, HTTP). It also includes a producer to queue data into a message broker like Kafka for downstream processing.

2. **`data_processing`**: Handles real-time data transformation and calculations. This is where traffic analysis and anomaly detection algorithms would go. It might use frameworks like Apache Spark for batch processing or Spark Streaming/Flink for real-time processing.

3. **`data_storage`**: Manages database interactions. This layer abstracts database connection details, schemas, and common data operations (CRUD) so that other parts of the codebase don’t directly depend on database specifics.

4. **`api`**: Provides endpoints to access processed traffic data and insights. For instance, you might expose endpoints to retrieve live traffic data, historic trends, or system status.

5. **`utils`**: Contains shared helper functions like logging, configuration loading, and validation that can be used across the project, ensuring reusability and cleaner code in the main modules.

6. **`main.py`**: The primary entry point of the application. It initializes the ingestion layer, starts data processing, and optionally runs the API server.

This organization will help keep the codebase modular and maintainable, making it easy to add new data sources, processing logic, or API endpoints in the future.
