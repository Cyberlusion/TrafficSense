For live traffic calculation using IoT and telemetry data, we’ll need a programming language that supports data processing at scale, real-time analytics, and integration with IoT protocols. Here are a few of the best options:

### 1. **Python**
   - **Why**: Python is widely used for data science and machine learning. Libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **scikit-learn** are beneficial for data processing and predictive analytics. 
   - **Real-time processing**: Integrate with real-time frameworks like **Apache Kafka** (for data streaming) and **Spark Streaming**.
   - **IoT Protocols**: Libraries like **paho-mqtt** make it easy to work with MQTT, a commonly used IoT protocol.

### 2. **JavaScript (Node.js)**
   - **Why**: Great for handling real-time data in web applications and dashboards. Node.js has a non-blocking I/O model that is ideal for handling data streams.
   - **Real-time processing**: Use frameworks like **Socket.io** for real-time communication and **Kafka-node** for streaming.
   - **IoT Protocols**: Libraries like **mqtt** enable Node.js to handle IoT protocols.

### 3. **Java**
   - **Why**: Known for its stability and scalability, Java is often used in enterprise-grade IoT applications.
   - **Real-time processing**: Works well with **Apache Flink**, **Kafka Streams**, and **Apache Spark** for handling real-time data.
   - **IoT Protocols**: Frameworks like **Eclipse Paho** and **Kura** provide MQTT support.

### 4. **Scala**
   - **Why**: Scala is often paired with Apache Spark, making it excellent for real-time, high-performance data processing.
   - **Real-time processing**: Direct integration with **Apache Spark** (written in Scala), **Kafka**, and **Akka Streams**.
   - **IoT Protocols**: Supports MQTT through libraries, though it’s less commonly used for direct device communication.

### 5. **Go (Golang)**
   - **Why**: Go is known for its speed and efficiency in handling concurrent processes, making it ideal for distributed systems and telemetry data.
   - **Real-time processing**: It has lightweight concurrency (goroutines), which helps manage multiple data streams efficiently.
   - **IoT Protocols**: Supports libraries like **gobot.io** for MQTT and other IoT protocols.

### Best Stack Recommendations:
- **Data Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka or Apache Pulsar for data ingestion and streaming.
- **Real-time Data Processing**: Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, or Kafka Streams.
- **Visualization and Monitoring**: Web dashboards (JavaScript) or Python-based tools (Plotly, Dash).
